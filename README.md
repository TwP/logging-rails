logging-rails
=============

A Railtie for for integrating the [Logging](https://github.com/TwP/logging)
framework into your Rails 3 application.

Features
--------

The railtie provides only one feature - integration of the **Logging**
framework into your Rails application. But this gives you quite a bit of
flexibility to format your log messages and direct them to multiple logging
destinations: stdout with colors, a rolling log file, email, or even get a
growl notification.

Install
-------

Add the ```logging-rails``` railtie gem to your Rails project's Gemfile and run ```bundle install```.

```ruby
gem 'logging-rails', :require => 'logging/rails'
````

A generator is included with the railtie that will create a ```config/logging.rb```
configuration file for use in your Rails project. Please run this generator
before attempting to use the **Logging** framework.

```
rails generate logging:install
```

Usage
-----

Out of the box, the **Logging** framework is configured to behave in the same
way as the standard Rails logger setup. The major exception is that the log
file will be rolled daily - gone are the days of 2GB log files on production
servers.

The railtie adds a configuration option, ```log_to```, that determines where
log messages will be sent. This is an array of appender names (an appender
writes log messages to some destination such as a file, STDOUT, syslog, email,
etc.). The appender configuration should be set in your environment specific
configuration file. For example, in production we would want to log to a file
and send emails on error:

```ruby
config.log_to = %w[file email]
```

The **Logging** framework sets the global log level from the ```log_level```
configuration item. However, each class can be assigned its own log level.
This is very useful when debugging a single controller or model in your
Rails application. Consider the example below. The overall log level for the
application is set to ```:info```, but the log level for the *User* model and
controller is set to ```:debug```.

```ruby
config.log_level = :info
Logging.logger['User'].level = :debug
Logging.logger['UserController'].level = :debug
```

When using the logging railtie, a small display of the current logging
configuration will be displayed when Rails is in development mode
(environment). A description of the display can be found
[here](https://github.com/TwP/logging/blob/master/lib/logging.rb#L400).

```
root  ............................................  *debug      -T
- <Appenders::Stdout:0x806bc058 name="stdout">
- <Appenders::RollingFile:0x806bbc0c name="file">
  ActionController::Base  ........................   debug  +A  -T
  ActiveRecord::Base  ............................   debug  +A  -T
  ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore  ...............   debug  +A  -T
  ActiveSupport::Dependencies  ...................   debug  +A  -T
  Logging  .......................................    *off  -A  -T
  Rails  .........................................   debug  +A  -T
```

This is useful for understanding more complex logging configurations. It can
be annoying in day-to-day usage. To disable, set the ```show_log_configuration```
setting to false in the environment specific configuration file.

```ruby
config.show_log_configuration = false
```
